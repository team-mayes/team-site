# Principal Investigator

## Heather B. Mayes

Heather studied humanities at Harvard University before realizing that she is a chemical engineer. She
received her B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
She then worked for three years as a chemical engineering consultant on projects 
including new technology development, process safety, and meeting new EPA standards. 
To deepen her knowledge, she returned to school and received her PhD in chemical 
engineering from Northwestern University in the summer of 2015. Dr. Linda J. Broadbelt 
at Northwestern advised her and [Dr. Gregg T. Beckham](http://www.nrel.gov/bioenergy/bios/gregg-beckham.html) 
of the National Renewable Energy 
Laboratory co-advised her as she employed computational chemical engineering to uncover 
the molecular mechanisms that underlie thermal and enzymatic cellulose decomposition 
toward advancing technologies that will produce sustainable chemicals and fuels. 
She was a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow and earned 
the AIChE Computational Molecular Science and Engineering Forum Graduate Student 
Award and ACS Chemical Computing Group Research Excellence Award. She is currently a 
postdoctoral scholar in the Voth Group at the University of Chicago, where she is 
modeling proton transport in transmembrane proteins. At the University of Michigan, 
she will elucidate protein-sugar interactions for applications in renewable energy and glycobiology.

# Graduate Student

## Stephen Vicchio

Stephen earned his B.S. in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), 
where he also conducted research at UMBC on hippocampal neuron cell signaling. He worked with
Shenkar Garde's group at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, completing an REU Summer Research Program 
simulating Janus particles at the water vapor-liquid interface. He additionally 
completed a Leadership Alliance Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship at 
Yale University and a FREEDM Systems Center REU at North Carolina State University.
