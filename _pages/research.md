# Using multiscale modeling to discover protein-sugar interactions and harness them for renewable energy and improved health

Nature has evolved a wide range of proteins responsible for storing energy in 
carbohydrates, transporting them, and cleaving their bonds to release energy, 
each exquisitely tuned to the unique stereochemistry of different sugars. These 
sugars also modify protein structure and function through post-translational 
attachment carbohydrates to proteins, with varied effects based on glycan 
composition and binding location. The study of carbohydrate-protein interactions 
is industrially important for efforts to harness biotechnology to create renewable 
fuels and chemicals from non-food biomass. Applications of this research also include 
human health, as defects in carbohydrate-active enzymes and protein glycosylation are 
implicated in human diseases including cancer, muscular dystrophy, and autoimmune disorders.

My group uses computational tools to probe these interactions at a wide range of 
length and time scales to answer questions ranging from fundamental understanding 
to industrial feasibility. We employ computational chemistry tools including quantum 
mechanics (QM), molecular dynamics (MD), and rare-event sampling methods to uncover 
fundamental understandings of protein-carbohydrate structure-function relationships, 
opening opportunities for rational design of enzymes and diagnostic tools. Collaborating 
with experimental groups, we aim to understand past and guide future wet-lab studies to 
advance renewable chemicals and fuels as well as health.
