  Welcome to the website for Team Mayes and Blue! We are a computational group in 
  the [Chemical Engineering Department](http://www.engin.umich.edu/che) 
  at the [University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) (Go Blue!). We focus on discovering 
  fundamental structure-function relationships that govern how proteins 
  and sugars interact in application from renewable materials to human 
  health.
